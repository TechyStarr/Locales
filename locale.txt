Geographical Hierarchy: Locale typically provides a comprehensive
hierarchy of geographical divisions. In the case of Nigeria, 
this would include regions, states, and local government areas (LGAs). 
These divisions help developers organize and categorize data based on specific locations.

Geolocation Services: Some developer tools offer geolocation services
that allow developers to determine a user's location based
on their IP address or other location-based data. This information
can then be used to provide customized content or tailor the user experience to a specific region.

Metadata and Attributes: Locale might provide additional metadata 
and attributes for each geographical division. This can include data such as population,
area, official languages, time zone information, and other relevant details 
that can assist developers in creating location-aware applications.

Integration and APIs: Developer tools like Locale often provide APIs 
(Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access 
the geographical data programmatically. This enables developers to 
integrate the data into their applications or services seamlessly.

Localization Support: In addition to geographical data, some developer
tools also offer localization support, including language translations,
date and time formats, currency symbols, and other cultural conventions
specific to a region. This helps developers create applications that are 
linguistically and culturally relevant to their target audience.
